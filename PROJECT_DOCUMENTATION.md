# IDENTIFYING AND DEFINING

## Need/opportunity in the school community
- In Gosford High School, students' music listening habits affect their studying and thus, their grades.

## Hypothesis
- My hypothesis is that various aspects of music listening will have an impact on students' confidence in their grades. I will test this by running a survey on GHS students in years 9-10.
